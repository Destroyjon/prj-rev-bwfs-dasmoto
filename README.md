This was a codecademy project using HTML/CSS to make a website.
I don't have any of the other websites I created, but after going through their course on making websites using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
I learned that I really enjoy working more with data, and algorithms than making things look appealing. 
I still enjoyed the process of learning those languages and applying what I've learned.
